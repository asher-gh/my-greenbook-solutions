# Week 3 : 14 Nov 2022

## Problem 1

Given a 2d array filled with 0s and 1s (a binary matrix), find the largest
rectangle containing only 1s and return its area.

```
Input: [[1,0,1,0,0],
        [1,0,1,1,1],
        [1,1,1,1,1],
        [1,0,0,1,0]]
Output: 6
```

Explanation: A 3\*2 rectangle is formed starting at row 1, column 2 and ending
in row 2 column 4.

## Problem 2

Give an $N \times N$ matrix of numbers, write a method to rotate the matrix by
90 degrees.

```
Input: [[1,2,3],
        [4,5,6],
        [7,8,9]]

Output: [[7,4,1],
         [8,5,2],
         [9,6,3]]
```

_Extension_ How fast can you go? Can you do this with O(1) space?

_Extension reloaded_ How fast can you transpose the matrix (flip it over a
diagonal)?
